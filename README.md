# CoolCompany

Fullstack Angular/Express application to perform CRUD operations with Todos.

## Pre-requisites

- Angular CLI https://angular.io/cli
- Nx https://nx.dev/
- NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/

## Development server

Run `ng serve cool-todo` for a UI dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng serve cool-todo-backend` for a Backend dev server. The API will be accesible via http://localhost:3333/. The api will also automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Both the UI and API have to be running in order for the application to be fully functional.

## Live demo

You can check a live version of the application running on https://fervent-jang-8e6d72.netlify.app/. Check pending topics for limitations of this version.

The API can also be found live on https://cool-todo-backend.herokuapp.com/api/todos.
